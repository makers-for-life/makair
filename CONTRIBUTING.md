## How to make a Contribution?

To make a contribution, we recommend that you first first try building and installing the project on your machine, then look at our [Issues](https://github.com/makers-for-life/makair/issues) to see if there is any request changes that you could already make (You can suggest changes also!). Then, when you are ready to change code, you must submmit a [Pull Request](https://github.com/makers-for-life/makair/pulls), for that you can do the following steps:

1. Make a fork from this repository, you can do this by clicking the "fork" button above (it is close to the star button! Make sure to hit that one too :D)
2. Clone the fork repository into your machine, you can do that by doing `git clone`
3. Make a new branch with a name that signifies your change, you can do that with `git checkout -b 'branch-name'`
4. Make the commits into this new branch with the changes you want to make. Add changed files with `git add filename` and commit with `git commit`
5. Then Push your changes into your branch, you can do that with `git push origin branch-name`
6. Go to the [Pull Request](https://github.com/makers-for-life/makair/pulls) page and you should have a Pull Request button to open your Pull Request!

Once your change it is submitted, it will be revised by one of our maintainers and if approved the merge can be made by one of the owners. Changes may be requested, in which case you can do by making more commits to your branch or rebasing it, depending on the changes requested.
